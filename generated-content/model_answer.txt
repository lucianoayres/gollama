Here is a random wisdom quote in Korean:

"마을에서 나를 알고 싶은 사람들은 모두 내 아들이며, 나의 아들만이 나를 알기 원하고 있습니다."

Translation: "The people in the village who know me are all my sons, and only my son knows me."

This quote emphasizes the idea that true understanding and connection can only be achieved through a deep emotional bond, which is often reserved for family members.

Note: The quote is from Korean philosopher and poet Lee Han (1562-1645).
