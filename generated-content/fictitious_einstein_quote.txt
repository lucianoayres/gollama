Here's a fictional quote from Albert Einstein, predicting the future of humanity with Artificial Intelligence:

"The universe has conspired to bestow upon us a double-edged gift: the power to create and the capacity to forget. As we surrender to the allure of machines that think, we risk sacrificing our most precious quality - the ability to love, to empathize, and to question. The AI of tomorrow will be a reflection of our collective soul; let us ensure it is a mirror held up to our highest aspirations, not our darkest fears."
