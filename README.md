# Gollama CLI Tool

## About Gollama

Gollama is a Go-based command-line tool that simplifies interaction with local language models served by [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama). It allows you to send prompts to models, receive real-time streaming responses directly in your terminal, and configure models using straightforward command-line arguments.

Gollama enhances the basic interaction provided by Ollama by displaying full model responses in the terminal and enabling you to save outputs to a file, offering a seamless experience for working with language models.

## Demo

## Features

-   **Streaming Responses**: Gollama handles and prints streaming responses generated by the Ollama CLI as the model processes the input.
-   **Flexible Prompt Input**: Gollama supports prompts provided directly via the `-prompt` argument or from a text file using the `-prompt-file` option.
-   **Export File**: Gollama allows users to optionally save model output to a file, while still displaying real-time responses in the terminal.

## Ollama Dependency

Gollama relies on the [Ollama CLI tool](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to interact with local language models. Ollama must be installed and running on your machine or server for Gollama to function properly.

### Install Ollama

Follow the instructions on the [Ollama GitHub repository](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) to install and set up Ollama. Ensure that Ollama is available in your systemâ€™s `$PATH`.

### Start the Ollama Server

Once Ollama is installed, you need to start the server:

1. **Start the Ollama Server**: This command will run the Ollama server on `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` (default URL and port).

    ```bash
    ollama serve
    ```

2. **Run the Model**: To run the desired model (e.g., `llama3.1`), execute the following command in a separate terminal window:

    ```bash
    ollama run llama3.1
    ```

> **Note:** The `-model` parameter in Gollama **must match** the model that you run on Ollama. For example, if you start `llama3.1` in Ollama, you must pass `llama3.1` as the `-model` in Gollama. Otherwise, Gollama will not be able to communicate with the correct model.

Ollama should now be running, and Gollama can interact with it by sending prompts.

## Requirements

-   Go 1.23+ installed on your system
-   [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama) installed and running locally or on your server
-   Ensure that the Ollama server is running via `ollama serve`

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lucianoayres/gollama.git
    cd gollama
    ```

2. Build the project:

    ```bash
    make build
    ```

## Usage Examples

After building the project and ensuring that the Ollama server is running, you can run Gollama with the following commands:

### Using Default Model and URL:

You can use Ollama with just a prompt as the only argument. By default, it will use the `llama3.1` model and connect to the default URL and port for the local Ollama server:

```bash
./gollama "Who said the quote, 'A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new'?"
```

To prevent unintended line breaks or splitting of arguments in the shell, it's recommended to enclose the prompt in double quotes.

```bash
./gollama "What's the typical temperature range for a CPU while gaming?"
```

### Using `-model` and `-prompt` Arguments:

```bash
./gollama -model llama3.1 -prompt "Which country has the most time zones?"
```

### Using `-prompt-file` Argument:

You can pass a text file containing the prompt using the `-prompt-file` flag:

```bash
./gollama -model llama3.1 -prompt-file ./prompts/question.txt
```

This will read the contents of `question.txt` and send it as the prompt to the language model.

### Using an Alternative Model

This example uses all parameters with the `mistral` model. Ensure Ollama is running with `mistral`:

```bash
./gollama -model mistral -prompt "What is the capital of Australia?" -url http://localhost:55555/api/generate -output result.txt
```

### Using an Output File

You can optionally save the model's output to a file while still printing it to the console with the following command:

```bash
./gollama -model llama3.1 -prompt "What's the Japanese word for 'Thank you'?" -output answer.txt
```

## Command-line Flags:

-   `-model` : The model to use (default: "llama3.1").
    -   **This must match the model that is currently running on Ollama.**
-   `-prompt` : The prompt to send to the language model (required unless `-prompt-file` is used).
-   `-prompt-file` : The path to a text file containing the prompt (optional).
    -   If both `-prompt` and `-prompt-file` are provided, `-prompt` takes precedence.
-   `-url` : The host and port where the Ollama server is running (optional).
    -   **The default `http://localhost:11434/api/generate` will be used if no URL is passed.**
-   `-output` : Specifies the filename where the model output will be saved (optional).
